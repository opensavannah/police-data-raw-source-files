# Help-Wanted: Help us clean up these workbooks, compile them into a single sheet, then export them as `.csv` files.
**TASK-DESCRIPTION**: We've got raw `.xlsx` workbooks of crime data from SCMPD that need to be cleaned and consolidated into a single spreadsheet for each weekly report. If you open the workbooks in Google Sheets or Excel, you'll notice the weekly summary as the last worksheet of the workbook. **For now, let's stick to that one sheet.**

# Sign up for a few workbooks to tackle by opening an [issue](/issues) here on GitHub. That way we won't overlap.


1. Remove all decorative formatting (images, link breaks, etc.) and summary rows so that there is only one (1) title field row with as many columns as there may be (typically crimetypes). 
2. Make sure you have a report date `date` column formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`.
3. When finished, export *just the last sheet with the weekly summaries* as a '.csv' and either submit it as a PR to this repository or post it to http://forum.opensavannah.org.
